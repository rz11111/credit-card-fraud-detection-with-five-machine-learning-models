# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Five Machine Learning Models
This repository encompasses a variety of business analytic projects including Python, Power BI, and Keynote.

## 1. Overview
This project focuses on credit card fraud detection, employing five distinct machine learning models coupled with under- and over-sampling techniques implemented in **Python**. Visualisations of the datasets are created using **Power BI**, while model performance evaluations are summarised using **Keynote**. By leveraging these tools, our primary objective is to effectively identify fraudulent credit card transactions and determine which machine learning models and resampling techniques yield the best performance.

## 2. Major Tools
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI Desktop
- Apple Keynote

## 3. Machine Learning Analysis
This **machine learning analysis** encompasses both data exploration and credit card fraud detection using various machine learning models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and neural networks using TensorFlow. These models are implemented with Random Under-sampling and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Below is the table of contents of the Jupyter Notebook.
